# Disposable Theme v3

phpVMS v7 theme/skin (Bootstrap v5.x + FontAwesome v5.x)  

* Theme supports **only** php8.1+ and laravel10
* Minimum required phpVMS v7 version is `phpVms 7.0.0-dev+240524.84ecc6` / 24.MAY.2024
* _php8.0 and laravel9 compatible latest version: v3.3.1_
* _php7.4 and laravel8 compatible latest version: v3.0.19_

## Compatibility with other addons

This addon is fully compatible with phpVMS v7 and it will work with any other addon, specially acars softwares which are 100% compatible with phpVMS v7 too.  

If the acars solution you are using is not compatible with phpVMS v7, then it is highly probable that you will face errors over and there. In this case, please speak with your addon provider not me 'cause I can not fix something I did not broke, or I can not cover somebody else's mistakes, poor compatibility problems etc.

If an addon is fully compatible with phpVMS v7 and needs/uses some custom features, then I can work on this theme to support that addon's special needs too.

As of date, theme supports vmsACARS.

## Installation

Same folder structure is used with phpvms v7, so if you have a default installation for it then installing the theme will take only seconds.  
Just extract the zip file at the root folder of your phpvms v7 installation and select the template from admin section.

### Non Standard Installation

If you want to manually upload the files or have a modified installation of phpvms please follow the instructions below;

* Contents of `public\image` should be placed in your *phpvms public* folder.
* Contents of `public\disposable` should be placed in your *phpvms public* folder.
* Contents of `resources\lang` folder should be placed under your *phpvms resources\lang* folder.
* Contents of `resources\views\layouts` folder should be placed under your *phpvms resources\views\layouts* folder.

According to your installation, `public` folder may be `public` or `public_html` or something else configured via your hosting control panel.

## Customization and Theme Cloning

Below you can find some details about the theme, customization of it and some minor technical info about duplication.

### Theme Cloning / Theme Duplication

* Just create a new folder under your `resources\views\layouts\` folder and name it `MyTheme`  
* Copy the `theme.json` file from Disposable_v3 folder to this folder.  
* Edit this file as below (only first two lines are shown to save space);

```json
"name"    : "MyTheme",        // Theme Name (and also the folder name)
"extends" : "Disposable_v3",  // Here we tell Laravel that we are extending Disposable_v3 theme
```

* Now copy any file you want to edit/change from `Disposable_v3` folder to your `MyTheme` folder, for example take `home.blade.php`
* From this moment on, if you switch to `MyTheme` from admin settings, this clone theme will be active and its contents will be used
* For the rest, non-modified files, `Disposable_v3` theme contents will be used

Technically you can copy any number of files to your new/duplicated theme. Just keep the file names and file paths intact, editing contents of the files is up to you.

### Theme Styling / Customization

* CSS, Stylesheet files are located under `/public/disposable/stylesheet/` folder.

There are two stylesheet files provided with the main package, one for general usage and holds all required styles in it `theme_v3.css`,  
Second one is for dark mode conversion and technically should hold only the items you want to change in a dark-theme `theme_v3_darkmode.css`

Unless really necessary for technical reasons, no hard coded style tags used in theme blades. So you can configure perrty much everything via css files.

### Defining a custom default Gravatar

You can simply define your own custom default gravatar for pilots. Just edit your `env.php` file and add below lines to the end of it  

```php
## GRAVATAR DEFAULT
GRAVATAR_DEFAULT_AVATAR='https://your.phpvms.url.comes.here/disposable/nophoto.jpg'
```

### Defining a custom FavIcon

Edit your duplicated `app.blade.php` and add below line to the `head` section

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="{{ public_asset('/disposable/your_airline_icon_file.png') }}"/>
```

### Using your own FontAwesome Kit

This theme uses FontAwesome v5.x by default and all blades are designed with them, for better performance and optimization you should define your own free kit from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) and then enter your kit url in your duplicated `app.blade.php`'s HEAD section like below

```html
<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/YOUR-KIT-CODE-HERE.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
Using theme provided kit code is NOT suggested on a live server because of the limits FontAwesome applying to page hits and loads.

### Customizing VA Logo images and Menu items

This can be achieved in two ways, either you need to change the image files provided in the package `theme_logo.png` and `theme_logo_big.png` or you need to edit blade files to use your own paths for your logos (preferred way)

Files holding logo definitions are `nav_side.blade.php`, `nav_top.blade.php` and `nav_menu.blade.php`

Both SideBar and NavBar uses the same file for menu items `nav_menu.blade.php`  
`nav_menu.blade.php` also holds the new language switching dropdown

## Settings (via theme.json)

There are some options defined in this file for quick settings or for pre-defined features to be enabled/disabled easily without editing blade files.

```json
    "name": "Disposable_v3",          // Theme Name

## About IVAO VA System Support

Recently IVAO introduced a new way to track registered VA flights, which is mostly automated and works along with their FPL system. A new field should be included in FPL ITEM 18 as `IVAOVA/nnn` where `nnn` is the ICAO code of the registered VA. Theme supports this new feature with SimBrief integration and if airline icao code is defined in theme settings required field will be included in all FPL's filed via theme SimBrief support.

_Below is the old notice about obsolete IVAO VA System logic, if you still need it or somehow use it related files will be in relevant folders._

As this is really an optional feature and the system itself is too old, it is provided only for VA's already using it. You should define your IVAO approved `Airline ID` and `Airline ICAO code` at theme.json file for the auto placed badges to show up.

Below you can find an example, it checks if you have necessary definitions at theme.json and includes the file. Which will have a visible badge/button, when clicked it will open up a modal window for the pilot to send the report.

```php
@if(Theme::getSetting('gen_ivao_vaid') && Theme::getSetting('gen_ivao_icao'))
  @include('pireps.ivao_vasys')
@endif
```

Be advised, IVAO's login cookies do not work properly even if you click "Remember Me". This is the reason of that "Login IVAO" button placed in the modal. It is higly advised that pilots click that button first, complete their login to IVAO, which will send them back to your VA, then click the "Send Report" button.

Here is an answer from [IVAO Official Wiki](https://wiki.ivao.aero/en/home/flightoperations/FAQ_VA) about VA System usage

```md
Do the pilots need to report their flights? 

Currently, the VA System is withdrawn, and not to be used anymore. The new VA system should be back alive in 2021. In the meantime, as we have no backup solution, no flight reporting is asked to pilots. 
```

## Footer Positioning and Content

As per the license, **addon/theme name should be always visible in all pages**. Editing the footer is still possible but `Disposable Theme` or `Powered By DH Addons` link **SHOULD BE** always visible.

```html
Powered by <a href="https://www.phpvms.net" target="_blank">phpVMS v7</a> & <a href="https://github.com/FatihKoz" target="_blank">DH Addons</a>
```
or
```html
Powered by <a href="https://github.com/FatihKoz" target="_blank">DH Addons</a>
```

If you need more space in footer area, kindly check theme stylesheet to add yourself some space 'cause it is really limited with a small area and always placed at the bottom.

## Known Bugs / Problems

* SmartCars v3 users reported problems with some of the features theme offers, root cause is SC3 being not fully phpVMS v7 compatible yet and not sending proper data. With latest improvements done to SC3 implementation incompatibilities are reduced but still it may behave different than expected. Please follow changes/updates of SC3 modules being develop by other devs.
